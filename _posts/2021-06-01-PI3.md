The one-commodity pickup-and-delivery travelling salesman problem (1-PDTSP) is a generalization of the Traveling salesman problem (TSP) in which the vehicle must either pick up or deliver known amounts of a single
commodity to a given list of customers. It is assumed that the product collected
from the pickup customers can be supplied to the delivery customers, the vehicle
can not surpass certain capacity, and finally, it must start
and finish the route at the node-depot. The distance between any pair of nodes is a known parameter
and the goal is to minimize the total distance of the route chosen.
