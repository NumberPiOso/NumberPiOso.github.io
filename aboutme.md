I am a **data scientist** who loves both equally software development
and data analysis (I can doubts from time to time).  

I aim for **continuous learning** and love to try the new
not yet finished things, create a github repository
and feeling the power.  

I love the **beautiful code** idea in general, testing and love well documented
software.  

**Linux** is my prefered working environment by far. I like that it is
lighweight, customizable and secure but I really love that it is
free and **open source**. I have participated in some open source projects
myself but I would really like to thrive a lot more into this.
