I am a **data scientist** who loves equally software development
and data analysis (I can doubts from time to time).

I aim for **continuous learning** and love to try new
yet unfinished things, create a github repository
and feeling the power.

I love the **beautiful code** idea in general, testing and well documented
software.

**Linux** is my prefered working environment by far partly because
it is lighweight, customizable and secure but mostly I really love that it is
free and **open source**. I have participated in some open source projects
myself but I would really like to thrive a lot more into this.
